# Defining whether a call is vishing

1. I have some video files of the vishing. I need to extract audio files from them. (video_to_audio.ipynb)

2. I aim to rename nonphishing audio files and save them in another directory. (nonphishing_renaming.ipynb)

3. Splitting one audio file into several segments based on whisper model's segment and segment_max_time (splitting_audio.ipynb)

4. Extracting image features from audio (image_features_from_audio.ipynb) 
NOTE: I aim to extract RGB image of each segment in an audio file.
